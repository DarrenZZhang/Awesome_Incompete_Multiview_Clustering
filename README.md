# A Survey on Incomplete Multi-view Clustering

### This toolbox is built for our comprehensive survey on Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (IMC)

The details can be found in the [IEEE TSMCA](https://github.com/DarrenZZhang/IMC_Toolbox). 

#### The program is to evaluate the IMC algorithms and this code is for the paper:  
J. Wen, Z. Zhang, L. Fei, B. Zhang, Y. Xu, Z. Zhang, J. Li, A Survey on Incomplete Multi-view Clustering, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems (TSMCA), 2022.

#### The Incomplete multi-view clustering solvers used in the paper are from the following websites:

For PMVC: The code of PMVC is released by the authors and can be download from the authors homepage: http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/lisy/  
S.-Y. Li, Y. Jiang, and Z.-H. Zhou, Partial multi-view clustering, in AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1969--1974, 2014.

For MIC and OMVC: Codes can be download from the authors' homepage at https://www.cs.uic.edu/~wshao/

For kenerl learning based IMC, the source code can be downloaded from: https://github.com/wangsiwei2010/multiple_kernel_clustering_with_absent_kernel

For incomplete multi-view data construction, you can use code 'splitDigitData.m' to generate the index of missing views.
