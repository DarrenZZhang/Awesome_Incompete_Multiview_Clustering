# A Survey on Incomplete Multi-view Clustering

### This program is built for our comprehensive survey on Incomplete Multi-view Clustering  
The details can be found in the [IEEE TSMCA](https://github.com/DarrenZZhang/IMC_Toolbox). 

#### Some Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMC) used in the paper are collected from the following websites:

For PMVC: The code of PMVC is released by the authors and can be download from the authors homepage: http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/lisy/  
S.-Y. Li, Y. Jiang, and Z.-H. Zhou, Partial multi-view clustering, in AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1969--1974, 2014.

For MIC and OMVC: Codes can be download from the authors' homepage at https://www.cs.uic.edu/~wshao/

For kenerl learning based IMC, the source code can be downloaded from: https://github.com/wangsiwei2010/multiple_kernel_clustering_with_absent_kernel

For incomplete multi-view data construction, you can use code 'splitDigitData.m' to generate the index of missing views.

#### Datasets: 
You may download the datasets from [baiduyun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Z87g3XXdSbT6KOXx1X5C4g?pwd=t98h) Code: t98h; After that, you can add these datasets to the 'dataset' fold.
